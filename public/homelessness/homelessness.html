            <h2>My Takeaways</h2>
            <p>
                Homelessness is a temporary situation. They're our neighbors who have fallen on bad times,
                yet <b>they're treated like they're invisible.</b>
            </p>

            <br>
            
            <p>
                I've sat at a traffic light feeling awkward, not knowing what to do or where to look, 
                as a homeless person held up a sign or played a instrument. I was allowing my awkwardness
                to feed into the abyss of loneliness and invisiblity that homeless people feel.
            </p>

            <br>

            <p>
                <b>I refuse to let my awkwardness make someone else feel invisible.</b>
            </p>
